# ODAS
Optic Disc Analysing System (ODAS)

This is my undergraduate project completed in 2015. The goal of this system is to create a patient information system that either creates a new patient or retrieves existing patient in the system. Once created, the users need to upload a retina image that will later be analysed using various image processing techniques automatically. If the selected region of interest is wrong, user will need to manually identify the region of interest. The image will later be analysed to determine the susceptibility of having glaucoma or not. Once user is satisfied with the result, user can save it inside the database for future use or download the results as a pdf file.

The libraries used in this project are:
- ImageJ
- iText
- mySQL-connector-java

Limitation:
Due to the limitation of skillset, the classification process was done using human intelligence and not through any machine learning algorithms. Besides that, the codes were not optimized for performance too as it is in early development back then. The project was taken over by other person and it is high likely the codes will be different. Thus, this project version is no longer maintained but it serves as a reference.
